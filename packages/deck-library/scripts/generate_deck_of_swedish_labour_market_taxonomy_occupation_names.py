"""Build the "Swedish labour market taxonomy: new and changed occupation names" deck from the
labour market taxonomy of Arbetsförmedlingen, the Swedish Public Employment
Service, in the solid-memo Turtle deck format: a Swedish
occupation name as it was -> what it is called today, and what changed; and a
name that is new -> when it came, and what it replaces.

Generates decks/swedish-labour-market-taxonomy-occupation-names.ttl. Python 3.10+, standard library
only. One snapshot of the taxonomy's occupation names is fetched per version
(~0.7 MB each); with --cache-dir they are kept, since a published version never
changes.

USAGE
  python3 scripts/generate_deck_of_swedish_labour_market_taxonomy_occupation_names.py \\
      -o decks/swedish-labour-market-taxonomy-occupation-names.ttl --creator "Name <email>" \\
      [--from 1] [--to 31] [--cache-dir DIR] [--verbose] [--allow-uncommitted] [--notes-file FILE]
  python3 scripts/generate_deck_of_swedish_labour_market_taxonomy_occupation_names.py \\
      -o decks/swedish-labour-market-taxonomy-occupation-names.ttl --check

  The deck starts from --from (default: version 1, the first) and runs to
  --to (default: the newest version). The script prints a report of what it
  included, excluded and adjusted and why, then the release notes and the
  `npm run deck:release` command that releases the deck with them
  (--notes-file also writes the notes to a file). --check writes nothing
  and says whether the taxonomy has a version the latest release lacks;
  the weekly workflow .github/workflows/taxonomy-deck.yml uses it.

SOURCE
  Arbetsmarknadstaxonomi, Arbetsförmedlingen (served by its JobTech API)
  https://taxonomy.api.jobtechdev.se/v1/taxonomy/   CC0 1.0 (as stated in
  Arbetsförmedlingen's DCAT record on dataportal.se), so the deck is CC0 too.

METHOD
  The static dumps on data.arbetsformedlingen.se list live concepts only, so
  the deck is built from the taxonomy's GraphQL API, which returns every
  occupation-name concept of a version, deprecated ones included, with the
  live concepts each deprecated one is replaced by:

    concepts(type: "occupation-name", version: N, include_deprecated: true)
      { id preferred_label deprecated replaced_by { id preferred_label } }

  Every card has a name on the front, with a note under it (card format 3),
  shown once the answer is revealed: the verdict, "In use" or "Out of use".
  Its back has a label that says how the answer relates to the name, the
  answer itself, what the name stands for today, and a note under it that
  says when. Two rules decide the cards. An outdated name is a name a
  concept had while it was live and no longer has, because the concept was
  renamed or deprecated. Its answer is what the concept is called today
  (itself if live, its successors if deprecated, " · " between them):

    Aktiemäklare (Out of use) -> "Replaced by" / "Finansmäklare" / "In taxonomy version 30, …"
    Motorman (Out of use) -> "Replaced by" / "Motorman fartyg" / "In taxonomy version 27, …"
    Arbetsledare, mureri (Out of use) -> "Renamed to" / "Arbetsledare, murning" / "In taxonomy version N, …"
    Asfaltarbetare (Out of use) -> "Replaced by" / "Asfaltverksmaskinist · Beläggningsarbetare" /
        "Renamed to Asfaltarbetare, asfaltframställning in taxonomy version 17; replaced in version 22, …"
    Scentekniker (In use) -> "Synonym added" / "Teatertekniker/Scentekniker" / "Teatertekniker added in …"
    Hamnarbetare/Stuveriarbetare (Out of use) -> "Synonym removed" / "Hamnarbetare" / "Stuveriarbetare removed in …"
    X (Out of use) -> "Ingen ersättare" / "Went out of use in taxonomy version N, …"

  A new name is a name a live concept has today that no live concept had in
  the first version read (give or take punctuation, spacing or word order).
  Its answer is what it replaces, if anything:

    Finansmäklare (In use) -> "Replacing" / "Aktiemäklare · …" / "Added in taxonomy version 30, …"
    X (In use) -> "Nytt yrke" / "Added in taxonomy version N, …"

  The answer is always Swedish, like the names: "Nytt yrke" (a new
  occupation), "Ingen ersättare" (no replacement). The notes and the label
  are in English and Swedish, and the app shows the reader's language.

  One card per name: a new name that later goes out of use keeps its card,
  whose back then tells what replaced it, and an outdated name that comes back
  into use becomes a new name again.

  Not cards: an old name that is today's name give or take punctuation,
  spacing or word order ("7-9" -> "7–9", "A/B" -> "B/A"), or exactly (a new
  concept with the same name, or a name the concept has again); and an old name
  a live concept has. Concepts that had the same outdated name share one card.

  The deck is cumulative, and meant to grow by one release per taxonomy
  version: a later run adds cards and changes backs, so an imported copy keeps
  its reviews when it is upgraded. A card of the previous release that no
  rule makes any longer (say, a name back in use as it was in the first
  version) is never removed but retired (owl:deprecated true), as it was last
  released: a copy keeps it and its reviews, but no longer studies it, and a
  later release can bring it back. Card ids come from the front alone
  ("<slug>-<hash>"), since the outdated name never changes; the replaced_by
  links are always read from the newest version, as the taxonomy repoints them
  rather than chaining (see below). Every card's dcterms:created is the time of
  the version its name went out of use in, so a re-run that finds nothing new
  changes no card.

  The names left out, and every inconsistency below, are printed as a report
  of what the run included, excluded and adjusted, and why, with examples
  (--verbose: every name), and written into the deck as a comment before
  <#generation>; the description sums up the exclusions.

INCONSISTENCIES IN THE TAXONOMY
  - The static dumps (all-concepts.json) list live concepts only, without
    replaced-by links: hence the GraphQL API.
  - Renamed back: version 16 put back some 200 earlier names, and version 17
    undid it. Old names are compared with today's name, not version by version.
  - Relabelled at deprecation: a deprecated concept often gets an older name
    back ("Hamnarbetare" deprecated as "Hamnarbetare/Stuveriarbetare"). Such a
    label was never in use, so it is never a card.
  - Replaced by the same name: the taxonomy often deprecates a concept and
    makes a new one with the very same name. No card.
  - Repointing: when a replacement is itself replaced, the taxonomy changes the
    older concepts' replaced_by rather than chaining, so a back can change.
  - Replacements missing: some concepts had none when deprecated and got one
    later; one version dropped the replacements of a few, and the next put
    new ones back. The back names the last replacement given, or none.
  - Revived: a few concepts were deprecated and later made live again.
  - Names reused: a deprecated name that a live concept has (e.g.
    "Skatterådgivare") is left out.

REPRODUCIBILITY
  The deck is a pure function of the taxonomy versions read, this script and
  the command line, and records all three, so it can be reproduced byte for
  byte, today or years from now:
  - the script: prov:wasGeneratedBy an activity associated with the script at
    a pinned commit, with the script's SHA-256 and the Python and Unicode
    versions it ran with (slugs and case folding depend on them). The script
    refuses to run unless it is committed and unmodified at HEAD
    (--allow-uncommitted writes a draft pointing at main);
  - the command line, without options that do not change the output
    (--cache-dir, --verbose, --allow-uncommitted);
  - every taxonomy version read: its number, publication time, the GraphQL
    query that fetched it, and a SHA-256 of the answer normalised as
    checksum() describes. Re-running checks the versions against an existing
    deck's checksums and refuses to overwrite it if one has changed.
  Nothing depends on the time or place of the run: the deck's
  dcterms:modified is the newest version's publication time, each card's
  dcterms:created that of the version it records, and the concepts are
  processed in id order.

  The description says what the deck is, not what a release did: that goes in
  the release notes, which the script writes by comparing with the deck's
  previous release, if any: how many names are new, how many changed (and how),
  and which cards were retired or brought back.

LANGUAGE
  Solid Memo is English first. The deck is in deck format 5, which states the
  title and description in several languages: English and Swedish (TEXTS),
  the app showing the reader's, and tags each keyword with its language
  (KEYWORDS). The notes and labels on the cards are in
  every language of TEXTS; the occupation names, front and back, are Swedish
  and tagged so. The cards are in card format 4, which states a text's
  language (card format 3 brought the notes and retired cards).
